White Paper (Disabilities School)
I am an epileptic who wasn't able to complete my undergraduate degree. This white paper introduces changes I need in the tertiary education systems of South Africa. 
I am starting a non-profit accredited tertiary institute to accommodate my learning challenges. 
The syllabus will range from programming to Statistics to African languages and Arabic linguistics.
I do not email for donations so be careful of fraudsters.
I am applying for accreditation in January 2022.
I need PhD volunteers to mark our papers.
Feel free to send me a message via Telegram (@redpomelotek) if you also struggle to pay for higher education. 
Thank you for reading!
